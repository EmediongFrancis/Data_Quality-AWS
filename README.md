# Data Quality and Consistency Solution
Inconsistent and poor-quality data can lead to incorrect business insights and decisions. Organizations often struggle with maintaining data quality and consistency across different data sources, which can include on-premises databases, cloud storage, and various data formats. Ensuring data integrity and consistency across these sources is critical for reliable analytics and reporting.

## Sample Scenario - MadHatter Corp.

To maintain data quality and consistency, we developed a solution using AWS Glue for data cataloging and ETL tasks, AWS DataBrew for visual data preparation, and Amazon Redshift for high-quality data storage and analysis. We also use Amazon RDS for ensuring relational database integrity. This architecture allows us to clean, normalize, and integrate data from various sources, ensuring that our analytics and reporting are based on high-quality, consistent data.
